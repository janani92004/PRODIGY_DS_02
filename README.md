Task 2 of Prodigy Infotech Internship
📊 Just wrapped up my latest data science internship project, and I'm thrilled to share the insights I uncovered using Zomato's dataset! 🍽️

📈 In the first dashboard, I delved into the dynamics of customer behavior by analyzing the number of orders placed online versus tables booked. The stacked bar graphs provided a clear visualization of how customers prefer to engage with restaurants, shedding light on trends and preferences in dining habits.

📍 Moving on to the second dashboard, I explored the geographical distribution of restaurants and their corresponding ratings, alongside the number of menu items and cuisines served. This analysis not only highlighted hotspots for culinary experiences but also uncovered interesting correlations between location, restaurant offerings, and customer feedback.

💡 Through these dashboards, I gained valuable insights into customer preferences, restaurant performance, and market trends, laying the groundwork for data-driven decision-making in the food industry.

🔍 Excited to leverage these skills and insights in future projects, and always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals in the field! Let's connect and discuss the fascinating world of data science together. 🚀 #DataScience #Analytics #Zomato #DashboardAnalysis
